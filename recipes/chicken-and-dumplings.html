    <h2>Instant Pot Chicken and Dumplings</h2>
    <p>This recipe is an easy way to make chicken pot pie in a pressure cooker rather than an over. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced carrot</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced celery</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 pound chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 pound chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen petite peas</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen cut green beans</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the olive oil into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant PotÂ®) and select the Saute function. Cook onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf until the vegetables are soft and the onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chicken broth, chicken thighs, chicken breasts, thyme, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 9 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
            <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Carefully remove the chicken pieces with tongs and place them in a bowl to cool slightly; discard bay leaf.</li>
            <li>Mash butter with the flour to make a smooth paste; set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl for the dumplings. Cut in cold butter until mixture is the texture of cornmeal. Stir in parsley and set aside.</li>
            <li>Shred cooled chicken and return to the pot. Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning if needed. Add peas and green beans. Stir in the flour-butter paste. Select Saute function to bring broth back to a boil.</li>
            <li>Pour buttermilk into the dumpling mixture and stir until combined. Drop the dumpling dough by heaping spoonfuls on top of the stew; a small cookie scoop works well.</li>
            <li>Cover pot with the lid, leaving the steam vent open. Select Slow Cooker function and simmer on Low, covered, until dumplings are cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. A skewer inserted in the center of a dumpling should come out clean.</li>
        </ol>
